# Loaf Billing - FiveM Invoice / Billing Script for ESX & QBCore
![example invoice](https://github.com/loaf-scripts/loaf_billing/blob/main/billing.png?raw=true)

## Features
* NUI, not only pressing a button in a menu
* Interest - pay x% extra for each day you haven't signed
* Signature - you need to actually sign the invoice, and this signature can be saved
* Transfer invoice - you can send your invoice to other players so they can view it (they will not be able to sign it)
* An event, `loaf_billing:bill_paid` containing all data, will be triggered upon payment
