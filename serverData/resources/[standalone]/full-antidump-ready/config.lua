-- folder is: script folder name, for example: if your resource not inside resources folder then added the folder that your script inside it, for example like this path:
-- resources/custom/yourscript/files. .. . .
-- you should make folder = 'custom' if is more then folder make it: folder = 'custom/otherone/'
-- if your script folder is inside resource direct then make folder = ''
-- so i have resouce name dev-gas and it inside folder [devx]

-- scripts: that's mean you load the script in local memory of lua or js language
-- so whiche script you want to make it antidump
-- for example i have html files like: html, css, js and i have lua: config.lua, client.lua
-- if your resource has config.lua you should added it at first on scripts
-- don't added images to scripts

DevConfig.AntiDump = {
    folder = "[devx]",

        {name = "config.lua"},
