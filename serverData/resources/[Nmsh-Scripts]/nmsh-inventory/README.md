So, I know the NoPixel 3.5 inventory update is a very controversial topic for most people. I wasn't a huge fan of it myself at first, but I liked the overall idea and concept behind it. So, here's my own take and spin on the design. This is was made off the awesome inventory [ihyajb](https://github.com/ihyajb) made

Runs at ~ 0.00 to 0.01 ms if you have more optimization suggestions feel free to reach out

# Important, If you want the decay to work follow this steps, this is not needed if you dont want to use decay
you need to add a decay and created value in your qb-core/shared/items for all items, the decay is set to be the days the item lasts
<br>

```lua
-- created = this will get filled in with the time when it's created, just leave this
-- decay = amount of days that an item will decay
-- delete = choice whether to remove the item when it's decayed or not
["created"] = nil, ["decay"] = 28.0, ["delete"] = true
```
<br>
Example:
<br>

```lua
['sandwich'] = {['name'] = 'sandwich', ['label'] = 'Sandwich', ['weight'] = 200, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'sandwich.png', ['unique'] = false, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true,	['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Nice bread for your stomach', ["created"] = nil, ["decay"] = 3.0, ["delete"] = true},
```
In this example our sandwich will decay in 3 days and removed when used.

In collaboration with [OnlyCats](https://github.com/onlycats) who helped reorganized and also created some custom images.
