## Licensing

<p>Do not at any point redistribute this without my permission and credit.</p>
<p>I've already had to issue reports on people selling my Television Script (which is free).</p>
<p>That is not fair to me and to the people who get scammed out of their money.</p>
<p>So please, respect the rules and have fun!</p>
