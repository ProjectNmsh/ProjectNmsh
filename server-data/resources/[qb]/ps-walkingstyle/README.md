# ps-walkingstyles
This may seem like a small feature, but it adds an extra level of immersion and personalization. This script allows players to set and save their preferred walk style, which will persist even after the server is restarted. Players can choose from a variety of walk styles, ranging from casual strolls to confident strides, and have their character consistently reflect their chosen style
